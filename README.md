# jobPortal
A PHP Project to develop a jobPortal

This is work in progress project. Currently I'm trying to create a working and robust backend. The approach is quite non-standard for
managing the back end.

Features:

1.Register as a user or recruiter.
2.User can create his profile showcasing his skills, projects, area of interest.
3.Recruiter can add new companies.
4.Recruiter can also add new job campaign giving exact requirements.
5.User is able to search for jobs.
6.The system will recommend jobs to the user based on his skills, area of interest, experience.
7.Admin will be able to add new emerging skills, companies, industry etc.
